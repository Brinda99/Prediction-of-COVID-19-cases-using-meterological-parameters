# Prediction-of-COVID-19-cases-using-meterological-parameters

## Problem Statement
The need for accurate and advanced prediction of Covid19 cases is increasing by day. The coronavirus pandemic has been declared a health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization for 2020. India has recorded a record high of more than 40,000 new case on April 30, 2021. Current study talks about possible relationship of Covid19 transmission with meteorological parameters namely humidity, temperature, rain, speed, and pressure. The weather data been collected from NASA archives. The daily number of confirmed Covid cases, deaths and recovered were extracted from a public website (https://data.covid19india.org/). Aggregated daily data was combined for a specific state for approximately nine months from 01-01-2021 and converted into a multivariable time series data frame. We then tried to build a Bi-LSTM architecture that gives the highest accuracy in predicting the number of confirmed Covid cases for n days based on given data.

## Methodology

The present study discusses about the possible relationship of the transmission of the Covid-19 with multiple weather parameters.
◦ Air Quality Index has been considered to study the efficiency of lockdown in reducing the transmission rate.
◦ Non-parametric tests such as Man-Kendall’s Test, Petit’s Test and Sen’s Slope Estimator have been used.
◦ The lagged (0-14) correlation coefficient has been computed between the different parameters such as weather, AIR (Air Quality
Index) and daily Covid-19 cases across Kerala (a state in India ) and the same has been fed to an Bi-LSTM ( Long Short Term Memory),
a deep learning model.

1. Bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM models were built to predict the number of daily confirmed covid cases upto 55 days into the future. The models were evaluated based on the MAPE score obtained during testing. 
2. The results showed a better performance for the bidirectional LSTM model compared to unidirectional LSTM model. The results showed that the four layered BiLSTM model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 99.99%. 

## Future Work

Future directions in this research include un-biased collection of more accurate weather data from weather stations. The accuracy of the model can be improved by using more data for training the model and by including new features into the dataset.
